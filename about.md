### Hi!

I'm Fyodor, an independent software developer and consultant working primarily with [web platform technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_platform). 

In this blog, I will try to contribute to solving the problem I faced (and face on) myself: the complexity of explanation for different tech aspects. I'm interested in all the stuff related to software development, from computer science problems to programmer jokes, from building a successful corporate career to freelancing and working on side projects. I hope to be useful for a reader so if you think I'm doing something wrong here (or if you just want to have informal chat on anything) please drop me a line at [fyodor.loenko@mailhero.io](mailto:fyodor.loenko@mailhero.io) or just find me on twitter by the icon below
